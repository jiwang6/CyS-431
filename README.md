# CyS-431

So apparently I'd rather do this than do actual homework.

## Homeworks

Grading focuses too little on comprehension and too much on the algorithms. Anyway, they're an easy source of points.

### Homework 1

I decided to this this entire homework in a Jupyter notebook because I thought I would get extra credit. I did not get extra credit but learned a lot about inline LaTeX. It was not worth.

Anyway, HW-1 focused on classical ciphers and basic entropy.

### Homework 2

From here on out, I hand wrote my homework

HW-2 focused on mod math and EEA.

### Homework 3

HW-3 focused on... I'm not sure but the script prints Fermat pseudo-primes.

### Homework 4

Literally prime checking and basic factor algos.

## PEXs

Haskell >> Python

### PEX 1

Fuck this pex. I over-engineered the timing methods and didn't put enough time into optimizing MR. Anyway, enjoy interpreting my shitty code.
